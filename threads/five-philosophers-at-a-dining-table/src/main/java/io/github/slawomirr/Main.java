 * The problem goes like this: five philosophers spend all of their time either thinking or eating. They sit around
 * a circular table with five chairs and five forks. There are only five forks and all five philosophers need to pick
 * the two nearest (one from his left and one from his right) forks to eat. Once a philosopher finishes eating, he
 * puts down both forks and starts thinking. A philosopher cannot pick up a fork if his neighbor is using it. What
 * happens if each of the five philosophers picks up one fork from his right and waits for his left fork to be
 * released by his neighbor?
